Hello! I am Aleksei, I am 28 years old, and this blog of mine is about my experience
undergoing two jaw surgeries â€” maxillary expansion in 2020 and double jaw surgery in 2022.

I consider myself quite terrible at writing anything,
especially long walls of texts, and I am also not a native English speaker. Because of that,
I have always been quite averse to the idea of having a proper blog,
even though I did dabble in LJ at some point.

However, going through one jaw surgery and getting ready to another
made me reconsider my position: it is relatively easy to find other people's stories
about their surgeries on Reddit and in FB groups,
those are usually shared in the form of short posts focused on a particular part of the process.
If you want to learn more of another person's journey, your options might be quite limited.
I myself only found a couple of detailed blogs from people who had jaw problems similar to me.

So I have decided to start this blog in the hope that it will be useful to someone
who's going to (or considers to) undergo through either SARPE (maxillary expansion)
surgery or double jaw surgery for an overbite.
