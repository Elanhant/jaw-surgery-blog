## Farewell food tour

I'm sure that many people who had to go through a surgery can confirm that you are not supposed to eat or drink about 10 hours before the procedure,
so you might want to have a nice meal early in the evening (especially if you have to wake up at 4:30 AM to go to the hospital).
For patients who have jaw surgery the situation is even more difficult — you are only allowed liquid foods for the first one or two weeks
after the procedure, and soft foods for several more weeks after that (YMMV, of course, depending on you case).

So as the date of my surgery was getting closer, I planned to enjoy as many of my favourite meals as possible, since I knew that I won't be able to have them at least for the next two (if not more) months. Over the course of a couple of weeks I have had pretty much everything that I've grown to enjoy since I moved to LA 5 years ago — Persian koobideh kabobs with zereshk rice, Polish gołąbki, Korean bibimbop, and the obligatory bagels for breakfast. For my final meal prior to the surgery, I got one of my favourite sweet treats — some honey cakes from the local Persian-Armenian bakery,
which are always such a great relief from the typical American cakes and pastries that are usually outrageously over-sweetened or covered in a thick layer of icing.

With my belly full from all of the above (and lots of protein shakes that I consumed to gain some additional mass), I thought I was pretty much ready for the operation.

## Pre-surgery anxiety

From the very moment when I had decided to go the surgery route to fix my bite problems, I had been feeling
more amused than terrified about this entire ordeal. I can't really tell why — perhaps the lack of prior surgery
experience, or maybe the confidence in my surgeon, Dr. Robert Relle, who is one of the best oral surgeons in the US.
Nonetheless, I was fully expecting to start properly freaking out closer to the actual double jaw surgery.

But even as I was actively getting ready for the surgery, I still did not feel much anxiety. I handed off my duties at work, cleaned my humidifer, picked up all the prescribed medications, made several creamy soups, ordered lots of protein shakes and powder, bought an ice and jade roller combo, ate my vitamins. In short, I was as ready as one could be for a jaw surgery, based on all the advice from both my surgeon's office and people on Reddit and Facebook. I had fewer worries than I usually have before going on a regular vacation!

## And then it almost went downhill

Well, as it turned out, the anxiety did strike, practically at the very last moment and for completely unexpected reasons.
In the evening of Wednesday May 11th, less than a day before my scheduled surgery, **I felt that I got sick**.

I was weak and tired, my throat was a bit dry, and in general I felt pretty much like I usually feel during the first day of a regular cold
(which I could easily catch at least once a year in the pre-COVID world).

Getting sick right before an oral surgery is obviously not ideal — even if the surgeon and the anaesthesiologist agree to proceed with the procedure,
having a stuffy nose is not going to help with the recovery, when breathing through the mouth is especially difficult.

It also didn't help that the only thermometer we have at home is ridiculously unreliable and was showing me anything between 98ºF (36.6ºC) and 100.4ºF (38ºC).
So I found myself trying to reach my surgeon's office to let them know about my current condition and see if we needed to reschedule
the surgery for another day. And this frightened me more than anything else about the surgery — I was fully expecting that the next
available date would only be in months; I felt completely prepared for the surgery to happen, I took a medical leave from work for 4 weeks to properly recover.
Rescheduling all of that just because of some mundane cold would be a huge mental blow to me.

Luckily, Dr. Relle returned my call, listened to my concerns and suggested to take a rapid COVID test if I can. We did have a couple of test kits
lying around, so I spent the next half an hour nervously reading through instructions, swabbing my nostrils and waiting uneasy 15 minutes
for the results to be ready. The test was negative, and Dr. Relle suggested to keep the surgery unless I feel worse when I wake up before going to the hospital.

And, as if by some miracle, I woke up at 4:20 AM next morning, feeling great and ready. A nurse took my vitals in the hospital as I was getting ready
for the procedure, and apparently everything was fine. Either I got some very short-lived bug or it was just my nerves. Whatever it was, the surgery went succesfully, but that is for another post.
